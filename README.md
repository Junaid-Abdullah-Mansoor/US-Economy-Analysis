# US Economy Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the US economy using various analytical techniques. The goal is to gain insights into different aspects of the economy and make predictions based on the available data.

## Description
The project begins by examining the distribution of factors calculated using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) function. A histogram is used to visualize the distribution, indicating that most of the factor values are centered around 0, with a range of -4 to +4. The analysis also includes a time series graph showing the changes in the PCA factor values over time, highlighting specific years where extreme values were observed.

Furthermore, the project evaluates a linear model to predict the values of the PCA factor during two phases of the US economy: expansion and recession. The model uses a set of variables, including 'INDPRO', 'S&P 500', 'PAYEMS', 'CPIAUCSL', and 'BUSINVx', to make these predictions. The performance of the model is assessed by comparing the predicted values with the actual values of these variables. The results indicate varying levels of accuracy for different variables and between expansion and recession periods.

## Future Steps
In future steps, the project aims to further explore the US economy by analyzing additional variables beyond the initial set of five. The goal is to identify variables that have a stronger correlation with the PCA factor and can provide better predictions. Additionally, the project plans to evaluate alternative machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of the predictions. It is suggested to increase the dataset length to enhance the training of neural networks, which may lead to more reliable results.

## Conclusion
The US economy analysis project utilizes analytical techniques to gain insights into the economy's behavior and make predictions based on available data. By examining the distribution of factors and analyzing a linear model's performance, the project provides initial findings regarding the relationship between different variables and the PCA factor during expansion and recession periods.
